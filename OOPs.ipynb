        "**Python OOPs Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm where you organize software design around objects rather than functions. These objects contain both data and methods (functions) that operate on the data, making it easier to structure and maintain code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It's a specific entity created from the class blueprint, with its own data and the ability to perform methods defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features.\n",
        "Encapsulation wraps data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts direct access to some of the object's components (like private variables).\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\") are special methods in Python, like __init__, __str__, and __len__, that allow you to define how objects behave with built-in operations (e.g., addition or string representation).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and the creation of more specialized classes from general ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism means the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call, each in their own way. This enables flexibility and the use of the same interface for different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using private attributes (prefixing them with _ or __) and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access or modify those attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor is a special method (__init__) used to initialize new objects of a class. It's called automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Class method: A method that belongs to the class, not the instance. It is defined using @classmethod and takes the class itself as the first argument (cls).\n",
        "Static method: A method that doesn't take the instance or class as a parameter. It’s defined using @staticmethod and operates independently.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Python doesn’t support method overloading in the traditional sense (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). Instead, it uses default arguments or variable-length arguments to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a getter for an attribute, allowing you to access it like an attribute rather than a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows for flexibility and extensibility in code. It enables objects of different classes to be treated uniformly, improving code reusability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that can’t be instantiated directly. It defines common methods for its subclasses, and those subclasses must implement the abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Advantages include better organization, code reuse, easier maintenance, modularity, and improved readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Class variable: Shared across all instances of the class.\n",
        "Instance variable: Unique to each object created from the class.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class, enabling it to combine behaviors and attributes from multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "__str__ is meant for creating a human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "__repr__ is for creating a more detailed, unambiguous representation, often useful for debugging.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "super() is used to call methods from a parent class, particularly in method overriding, to ensure that the parent class’s method is properly invoked.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "__del__ is a destructor method, called when an object is about to be destroyed, to clean up resources like closing files or releasing memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "@staticmethod is used for methods that don’t operate on the class or instance.\n",
        "@classmethod is used for methods that operate on the class itself and can modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows a subclass to override a method from the parent class, so the same method name can behave differently depending on the class of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single line, one after another, by having each method return self.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. It’s a special method that makes an object callable.\n",
        "\n",
