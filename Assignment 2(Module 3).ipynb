They're important because they help optimize performance and solve specific problems, like storing a list of items or ensuring quick lookups.\n","\n","2.What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n","ANS=\n","Mutable types can be changed after creation (e.g., lists), while immutable types cannot (e.g., strings, tuples). A list can have its elements modified, but a string's value cannot change once defined.\n","\n","3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","ANS=\n","Lists are mutable (can be modified), whereas tuples are immutable (cannot be modified). Tuples are often used for fixed data that shouldn't change.\n","\n","4.Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","ANS=\n","Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a value, allowing for fast lookups.\n","\n","5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","ANS=\n","Sets automatically remove duplicates and are faster for membership tests. Use them when you need unique elements and don't care about the order.\n","\n","6.What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","ANS=\n"," A string is a sequence of characters, and it's immutable. A list can store various data types and is mutable, meaning you can change its elements.\n","\n","7.How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","ANS=\n","Tuples ensure data integrity by being immutable. Once created, their values cannot be changed, preventing accidental data modification.\n","\n","8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python? ANS=\n","A hash table is a data structure that stores data using a hash function to map keys to values. Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables for fast lookups.\n","\n","9.Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","ANS=\n","Yes, lists can store elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, or even other lists.\n","\n","10.Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","ANS=\n","Strings are immutable to ensure consistency and avoid accidental changes, making them safer and more efficient when used as keys in dictionaries.\n","\n","11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","ANS=\n","Dictionaries provide fast lookups by key, making them better than lists for tasks where you need to quickly access, insert, or modify data by a specific identifier.\n","\n","12.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","ANS=\n","Tuples are ideal when the data shouldn't change, like coordinates (x, y, z) or fixed configuration settings.\n","\n","13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","ANS=\n","Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values, ensuring that only unique items are stored.\n","\n","14.How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries? ANS=\n","In lists, \"in\" checks if an element exists. In dictionaries, \"in\" checks if a key exists.\n","\n","15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n","ANS=\n"," No, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.\n","\n","16.What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","ANS=\n"," A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside another dictionary. It's useful for representing hierarchical data, like a contact book with addresses and phone numbers.\n","\n","17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n","ANS=\n","Accessing elements in a dictionary is usually O(1) (constant time), meaning it’s very fast, regardless of the size of the dictionary.\n","\n","18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","ANS=\n","Lists are preferred when the order of elements matters or when you need to store a sequence of items without key-value mapping.\n","\n","19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","ANS=\n","Dictionaries don’t guarantee order in how they store key-value pairs. However, you retrieve values using keys, not positions, so order doesn’t impact performance.\n","\n","20.Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","ANS=\n","In a list, data is accessed by its index (position). In a dictionary, data is accessed by its key, which doesn’t depend on order.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OSAMcrdNWg58"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Practical
